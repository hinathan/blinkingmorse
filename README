The Prometheus movie website has a blinking star that's showing Morse code as a hint to more teaser content.
 Let's decode that blinking using computers, since I'm too lazy to learn Morse code but not so lazy as to write
 a program to do it for me. It's not a perfect signal (looks like it was digitized from a source with a different
 input frame rate as the animated GIF so we'll have to do some quantizing and massaging.

Spoiler: 
 This code produces the output 'EDIR6EQUJ5E' which is a hint to the path 
 https://www.weylandindustries.com/6EQUJ5 which shows a nice concept painting of an Orrery, hopefully from the
 upcoming movie. Only makes sense if you get the reference to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wow%21_signal
